# SnakeGame
This project is called a snake game. This game is a console application and used C# to program this game. We have at least four obstacles to make this a fun game. The snake will die if it goes over the edge of the confined area or hits the obstacles. After the snake dead, the time user lasts to service will print out in the console.
